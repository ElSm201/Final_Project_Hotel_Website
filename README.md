## Application Functionality: 
User Accounts & Roles: By having customers and employees use the website, we can have different roles, allowing different actions for reservations.
# Database: 
Guest reservations will be stored in a database and can be canceled by staff.
# Interactive UI:
Our website will be updated dynamically when a room is booked to prevent double booking.
# New Library or Framework: 
React Hook Form is used with modals to help minimize re-rendering while working with MUI. 
# Internal REST API:
Can use Spring Boot to help create REST API
Example API’s:
Reservation service, Payment service, Room service, Account service
# External REST API: 


# User Story / Use Case: Explain what happens when a user visits your application and what features they can interact with.
# Customer: 
The customer will be greeted with a welcome page displaying a brief overview of the hotel.
The customer will be able to navigate to select a room and date 
If interested, the customer will be able to read reviews and book a room.
Once booked, the customer will be added to the database.
# Employee: 
The employee will log in from a link on the homepage 
They will be able to see all reservations for a certain date. 
Additionally, they will have the ability to cancel reservations and make edits.
# Technical Design:
Tech stack (Frontend, Backend, Database, Libraries, etc.)
We will develop a database with DBeaver to hold the reservations for customers. 
The database will also allow employees to log in and have access to more information in the database.
We will also use React to create the main website.
React will also allow us to ensure we don’t double-book a room.
We will use Node.js/Express for the backend.
MUI will also be used to help with the visuals of the website
