### Customer: 
The customer will be greeted with a welcome page displaying a brief overview of the hotel.
The customer will be able to navigate to select a room and date 
If interested, the customer will be able to read reviews and book a room.
Once booked, the customer will be added to the database.
### Employee: 
The employee will log in from a link on the homepage 
They will be able to see all reservations for a certain date. 
Additionally, they will have the ability to cancel reservations and make edits.
### Technical Design:
Tech stack (Frontend, Backend, Database, Libraries, etc.)
We will develop a database with DBeaver to hold the reservations for customers. 
The database will also allow employees to log in and have access to more information in the database.
We will also use React to create the main website.
React will also allow us to ensure we don’t double-book a room.
We will use Node.js/Express for the backend.
MUI will also be used to help with the visuals of the website
